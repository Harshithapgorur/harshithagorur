3.Converting a subclass type into a superclass type is called Generalization ,
Converting parent class into child classis called specialized.
4.a) We have the classes as final we can not inherited by any other classes.
c) Delegation can be an alternative to inheritance.
5)Linked,ArrayList,LinkedHashset,link,set.
6)What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements,ArrayList is slow as array
 manipulation is slower
LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements,
LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.
7)Iterator:- can traverse the elements in a collection only in forward direction.
ListIterator :-can traverse the elements in a collection in forward as well as the backwards direction.
8)Covariant return type refers to return type of an overriding method.
9)memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs 
when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations 
10)methodoverloding anf methodoverriding.
